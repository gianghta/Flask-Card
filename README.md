**Flask Card** is a personal project for my own good. My attention span when I'm connected to web is reduced signficantly (sadly) so sometimes, knowledge deteriorates. I just couldn't bare forgetting CS concepts that might save my @ss. So I made this flashcard app with Flask with Markdown supported for code snippet.
